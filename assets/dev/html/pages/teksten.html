            <p>I have been attempting to make some SVG data charts responsive but seem to be unable to do so with the current
                CSS 'position:fixed' applied to the elements. I'm looking for, if possible, a solution that doesn't rely
                on media queries as I have multiple elements that I would need to apply this to. If this isn't possible,
                then any suggestions on what to do in order to keep all the data matched up with the SVG as the browser
                is resized, would be great!</p>
